<h1>Shopping</h1>

<p style="width: 600px;">
      This is where users start shopping. They can browse and/or search a catalog 
      of products.  The app demonstrates navigation patterns you find in most apps: searching, filtering, 
      sorting, and master-detail. The master-detail paradigm is demonstrated by product and order pages. 
      The list of products represents the master and the product details page represents the detail. 
      Similarly with orders and order details.

    For additional functionality, including pagination and a shopping cart, please check 
    the <i>Spark 4.5</i> web reference application called <i>Art Shop</i>.
